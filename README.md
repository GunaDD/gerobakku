## 💡 Idea

**Street vendors are the heart of Indonesia.**  
They contribute up to **58% of the economy**, yet they lack visibility and digital infrastructure.  

### The Problem  
Street vendors don’t have a platform to:
- Advertise their **menu** or **highlight** their specialties
- Share their **personal story**
- Receive **reviews** and **ratings**
- Accept **donations** to improve food/service quality
- Maintain a **consistent customer base** due to mobility

---

## 🚀 Our Solution

**Gerobakku** provides:
- 🗺️ A real-time **public map** of all registered street vendors  
- 📱 Live **user location tracking** so customers can always find their favorite vendors  
- ❤️ Vendor **profiles** with menus, stories, donation options, and review systems  
- 📊 Visibility into **popular vendor areas** to help vendors find high-traffic locations  

This ensures **vendors grow**, **customers stay connected**, and **communities thrive**.
